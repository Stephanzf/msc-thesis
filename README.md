This is my Master of Science Thesis. The long title is "A COMPREHENSIVE STABILITY INVESTIGATION OF 
THE ATHABASCA-POINTS NORTH POWER SYSTEM". There is a software tool written in FORTRAN producing the simulation results. The project was supported partially by SaskPower, the Provincial Utility of Saskatchewan, and partially by Supervisors' research grants. The software tool will be open-sourced on this site.
